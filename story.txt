It was October 2nd, 2020.  An average Fall day for most of the midwest,
but a very important occasion for the students of UW Madison -
it was Bucky the Badger's birthday.

Unfortunately, everyone forgot. There was one student that didn't forget
though. He celebrated with Bucky.

Bucky was so grateful, he gave the student several hundred wheels of cheese.
Oh, and an A, but who cares about that when there's cheese to be eaten? Day
in, day out, all the student ate was cheese.
