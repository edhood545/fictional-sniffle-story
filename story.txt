It was October 2nd, 2020.  An average Fall day for most of the midwest,
but a very important occasion for the students of UW Madison -
it was Bucky the Badger's birthday.  Unfortunately, everyone forgot.

There was one student that didn't forget though. He celebrated with Bucky.

Bucky was so grateful, he gave the student several hundred wheels of cheese.
Oh, and an A, but who cares about that when there's cheese to be eaten? Day
in, day out, all the student ate was cheese.

While Bucky was a little sad only one of his 40,000 some friends remembered
his birthday, he was still glad to celebrate with the one who did.  The 
student, of course, was just as glad to be with Bucky and deeply thankful 
for the many wheels of cheese he was gifted.  In the end, it's not the 
number of people you know but the strength of the connections you have.
